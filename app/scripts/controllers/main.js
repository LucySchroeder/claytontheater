        summary: 'Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, this Pulitzer Prize-winning \
        1990 play by American playwright August Wilson follows the lives of the Charles family and an heirloom, the \
        family piano. The play focuses on the tension between family members who treasure the piano as a link to \
        the family history, and those who want to sell the piano to improve the family\'s economic status. What The \
        Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: "What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use?"',

        summary: 'This witty comedy of manners follows a group of women through the perils of adultery, divorce and \
        finding a unique voice in a sea of gossip and innuendo. The 1936 play continues to echo a relevant look in \
        the complex nature of relationships.',

        summary: 'This play fictionalizes the 1925 Scopes "Monkey" Trial which resulted in John T. Scopes\'s conviction \
        for teaching Charles Darwin\'s theory of evolution to a high school science class, contrary to a Tennessee state \
        law. The theme of intellectual freedom explored in the play applies to many other ideological debates, such as \
        the McCarthy trials that were going on at the time it was written in 1955. According to the playwright, "We used \
        the teaching of evolution as a parable, a metaphor for any kind of mind control. It\'s not about science versus \
        religion. It\'s about the right to think."',
