CCT’s purpose then, as now, was to provide a vehicle for all members of our community to be involved in the production of top quality live theatre. Through its three annual productions and through its program of community outreach, CCT has involved hundreds of individuals in productions that have played to consistently enthusiastic reviews and crowded houses.</p> <p>CCT believes that our successful history as a theatre company has proven that there is an important place in our community for a volunteer theatre company that is open to all and driven by a commitment to excellence.</p> </h3></h3></div> <div class="venue"> <h3>Our Theater<h3> <p>In the fall of 2006, CCT began operations in our new home on the campus of Concordia Seminary in Clayton (the former CBC High School building). In the fall of 2007 this property was purchased by Washington University in St. Louis, and is now known as the Washington University South Campus. The theatre is an outstanding 210-seat venue with handicap accessibility, elevators, and a lighted parking lot. CCT operates on the Washington University campus as an independent community theatre company and is not affiliated with the Washington University Performing Arts Department.</p> </h3></h3></div> </div> </div>
