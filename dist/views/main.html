CCT’s purpose then, as now, was to provide a vehicle for all members of our community to be involved in the production of top quality live theatre. Through its three annual productions and through its program of community outreach, CCT has involved hundreds of individuals in productions that have played to consistently enthusiastic reviews and crowded houses.</p> <p>CCT believes that our successful history as a theatre company has proven that there is an important place in our community for a volunteer theatre company that is open to all and driven by a commitment to excellence.</p> <p>The Clayton Community Theatre was founded by a group of Clayton residents interested in expanding access to the performing arts through community theatre. The organization’s motto is “Places everyone,” the announcement traditionally made by the stage manager a few moments prior to curtain to call the actors and crew to readiness. The motto reflects the goals of Clayton Community Theatre, which are: to offer Clayton and surrounding communities top-quality theatrical entertainment; to showcase local talent; and to provide any interested member of our community the opportunity to become involved in theatre production. We are a volunteer-driven organization and welcome all theatre lovers interested in assisting in our productions.</p> <p>Clayton Community Theatre derives revenue primarily from ticket sales, with additional support from program advertising, contributions, sponsorships and grants.</p> </h3></h3></div> <div class="venue"> <h3>Our Theater<h3> <p>In the fall of 2006, CCT began operations in our new home on the campus of Concordia Seminary in Clayton (the former CBC High School building). In the fall of 2007 this property was purchased by Washington University in St. Louis, and is now known as the Washington University South Campus. The theatre is an outstanding 210-seat venue with handicap accessibility, elevators, and a lighted parking lot. CCT operates on the Washington University campus as an independent community theatre company and is not affiliated with the Washington University Performing Arts Department.</p> </h3></h3></div> </div> <div class="slideshow"> <photo photos="photos1"></photo> </div> <div class="participate"> <div class="membership"> <h3>Membership</h3> <p>As is true of most nonprofit theatre companies, Clayton Community Theatre depends on the generosity of its supporters to bridge the financial gap between ticket revenue and production costs.

Scopes's conviction for teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to a high school science class, contrary to a Tennessee state law. The theme of intellectual freedom explored in the play applies to many other ideological debates, such as the McCarthy trials that were going on at the time it was written in 1955. According to the playwright, “We used the teaching of evolution as a parable, a metaphor for any kind of mind control…. It's not about science versus religion. It's about the right to think.”</p> <p>Primary characters:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Matthew Harrison Brady</strong>, a three-time presidential candidate and nationally known attorney. He is a dynamic public speaker, even though he is in his late 60s or early 70s. He believes the Bible is the word of God, and that every word of it is absolute truth.</li> <li><strong>Henry Drummond</strong>, another nationally known Chicago attorney who was once Brady's closest friend and political confidante. He is about the same age as Brady. Drummond is an agnostic, and while he does not discount the important lessons to be learned from biblical scriptures, he also wants them to be read and weighed alongside other books. Above all, Drummond puts his faith in the power of the human mind to think and reason.</li> <li><strong>Bertram "Bert" Cates</strong>, a Hillsboro high school teacher in his 20s who has taught the theory of evolution in violation of a state law banning its teaching in classrooms. He has a particular axe to grind with Reverend Brown's fire-and-brimstone preaching.</li> <li><strong>E. K. Hornbeck</strong>, a reporter for the fictional Baltimore Herald newspaper. He is young, sarcastic, cynical, and deeply opposed to religious belief. May be cast as a woman.</li> <li><strong>Rachel Brown</strong>, the Reverend Brown's daughter. She is 22 and the romantic interest of Bertram Cates. Her loyalties are torn between her father and Cates, and she is easily manipulated by others.</li> <li><strong>Reverend Jeremiah Brown</strong>, Christian fundamentalist preacher of indeterminate denomination who believes in the literal interpretation of the Bible.</li> <li><strong>Mrs. Brady</strong>, wife of Matthew Harrison Brady. A kind, and gentle woman, she is more concerned for her husband's health and well-being than she is for her husband's cause.</li> </ul> <p>Secondary characters:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Judge</strong>, subtly sympathetic to Rev. Brown's views.</li> <li><strong>Howard Blair</strong>, a 13-year-old high school student who was in Bertram Cates' class.</li> <li><strong>Melinda Loomis</strong>, a 12-year-old girl who believes strongly in the Bible.</li> <li><strong>Tom Davenport</strong>, the local district attorney who prosecutes Bertram Cates with Brady's assistance.</li> <li><strong>The Mayor</strong>, the top elected official of Hillsboro who is openly supportive of the Rev. Brown but also deeply political and concerned about the economic future of his town.</li> </ul> <p>There are also a number of minor speaking roles including <strong>Meeker</strong>, a bailiff at the Hillsboro courthouse; <strong>Mrs. Krebs</strong>, a loudly outspoken supporter of Rev. Brown and leader of the Ladies' Aid Society; <strong>Mr. Bannister</strong>, a local citizen; <strong>Elijah</strong>, an illiterate man from the nearby woods who sells Bibles to the crowd; <strong>Harry Esterbrook</strong>, a radio reporter from Chicago; <strong>Jesse Dunlap</strong>, a local farmer; <strong>George Sillers</strong>, an employee at the feed store; and the <strong>Storekeeper</strong>, Sillers' employer.</p> </div> <div class="slideshow"> <photo photos="photos2"></photo> </div> </div>
